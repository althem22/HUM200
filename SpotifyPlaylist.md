Hacking Humanities
1. Hide in Your Shell -- Supertramp
An awesome band from the '70s - '80s. This song represents how I was feeling before I left for college.

2. Free Four -- Pink Floyd. Another indubitably awesome band from the '60s. This song is an introspective song about growing old, and that's what I was thinking about as I set off to go to college.

3. Steppin' Out -- ELO. Yet again another great '70s - '80s band. This song is pretty self explanatory

4. Brother Where you Bound -- Supertramp. This is a song tha piggybacks off the last one.

5. When I'm Small -- Phantogram. A cool band from Portland, Oregon. This song represents how I was kind of lost when I first came to college in Chicago and felt really small.

6. Up Up & Away -- Kid Cudi. The ultimate lonely stoner rapper. Cudi raps about being lonely and finding his own way around without the help of other people. This song represents how I felt after I kind of gained my footing at IIT.

7. Sundown Syndrome -- Tame Impala. This band from Australia are like the neo-psychedelic rock kings right now. This song is my go-to walking song and represents how after I figured myself out at IIT how I could walk around unhindered.

8. My World -- Kid Cudi. Kind of self explanatory, I felt like I could conquer the world at this point.

9. Isabella of Castille -- STRFKR (pronounced Star Fucker). This band from Seattle does a lot of psychedelic techno, and this song is about how a guy has to leave but he wants to stay with somebody he loves. This is how I started to feel about home.

10. Led Zeppelin -- The Rain Song. Led Zeppelin requires no intro. This is my go to sad --> happy song. The Song Remains the Same concert movie plays very well with it.

11. Pond -- O Dharma. Pond is made up of the same band members and Tame Impala, but is lead by their heroin-addicted bassist rather than fronted by their straight edge producer. I am a big fan of eastern religion, and this song speaks to me in a way no other does.

12. Tame Impala -- Solitude is Bliss. Once I started to miss home, I felt alone. But I realized that it's not necessarily a bad thing. This song helped with that.

13. Temples -- Move with the Seasons. An up and coming neo-psych band from Essex, this song represents how after I began to feel alone and sad I'd just pop in my earbuds and go with the flow, which helped me a lot.


14. Pink Floyd -- Wot's .. Uh the Deal. I could probably write a 5 page essay on this song, but I'll leave the last verse instead: 
Hear me shout "Come on in,
What's the news and where you been?"
Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old

15. Gwen Stefani -- What You Waiting for? Everyone has to add some Gwen Stefani to their playlist. When I don't know what to do .. what you waiting for?

16. Pond -- Zond. My favorite up-beat song ever.
